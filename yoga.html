							<h1>MY JOURNEY</h1>
							<p>
								My yoga journey started several years ago. My early experience was hatha yoga, a practice of slow-paced yoga. It pairs gentle asanas and breathing techniques. I had been practicing hatha yoga for two years, and then I have switched to kemetic yoga, an African yoga practice that focuses on asanas, deep breathing and meditation. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Both practices slow me down. They reduce stress and tension, relieve anxiety. Make me sleep better. Help to create calmness. I learn to listen to my body and mind and find what feels good.

							<h1>MY PRACTICE</h1>
							<p>
								My practices are often set at home. I do yoga with Adrien Mishler and Sarah Wesley, online yoga instructors. Adriene does traditional practices with development movements, storytelling and mindfulness. Her practices embody creative yoga, playfulness, wisdom and humor. She is a great instructor for yogis of all levels. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I also enjoy practices with Sarah Wesley, a kemetic yoga and meditation instructor. Her yoga practice combines kemetic yoga elements, ancient yoga practices and African spirituality. Through mindful workshops, she provides knowledge on how to renew, remember and reawake yourself. I recommend Sarah for yogis who like yoga flow practices and self-discovery.
