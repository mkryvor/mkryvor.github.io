							<h1>MY JOURNEY</h1>
							<p>
								My yoga journey started with hatha yoga, a practice of slow-paced yoga. It pairs a practice of physical postures and breathing techniques. I have been practicing hatha yoga for two years until I have switched to kemetic yoga practices, a yoga practice with African roots which focuses on postures, deep breathing and meditation.  
							</p>
							<p>
								Yoga practices slow me down, reduce stress in my body. They decrease tension and make me sleep better. They help to create calmness and mental well-being. They teach me to listen to my body and mind and find what feels good.

							<h1>MY PRACTICE</h1>
							<p>
								My practices are often set at home. I like doing yoga with Adrien Mishler and Sarah Wesley, online yoga instructors. Adriene combines traditional practices with development movements, storytelling and mindfulness. Her practices embody creative yoga, playfulness, wisdom and humor. She is a great instructor for yogis of all levels. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I also enjoy practices with Sarah Wesley, a kemetic yoga and meditation instructor. Her yoga practice combines kemetic yoga elements, ancient yoga practices and African spirituality. Through mindful workshops, she provides knowledge on how to renew, remember and reawake yourself. I recommend Sarah for yogis who like yoga flow practices and self-discovery.
